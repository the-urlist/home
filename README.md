## What Is This?

The Urlist is a production application that tests and proves application implementation scenarios for serverless applications running on Microsoft Azure. Read more about the project in the [announcement blog post](https://dev.to/azure/the-urlist-an-application-study-in-serverless-and-azure-2jk1).
